# SimpleScript Example Program
# This program demonstrates various features of SimpleScript

# Initialize variables
a = 5
b = 10

# Basic arithmetic
sum = a + b
difference = a - b

# Print results
print sum      # Should output 15
print difference  # Should output -5

# If-else statement
if a == 5
  print 100    # This will execute
else
  print 200

# Change value and test if-else again
a = 7
if a == 5
  print 300
else
  print 400    # This will execute

# While loop
counter = 1
while counter != 6
  print counter  # Will print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  counter = counter + 1

# Nested structures
result = 0
if a != 5
  result = 50
  if b == 10
    result = result + 25  # result becomes 75
  else
    result = result + 5
else
  result = 100

print result   # Should print 75
