# SimpleScript Calculator
# A program that performs different operations based on a selection

# Define the numbers to operate on
num1 = 15
num2 = 5

# Define the operation:
# 1 = addition
# 2 = subtraction
operation = 2

# Perform the selected operation
result = 0

if operation == 1
  # Addition
  result = num1 + num2
  print result    # Should output 20 if operation is 1
else
  if operation == 2
    # Subtraction
    result = num1 - num2
    print result  # Should output 10 if operation is 2
  else
    # Invalid operation
    print 255     # Error code

# Test with a different operation
operation = 1
if operation == 1
  # Addition
  result = num1 + num2
  print result    # Should output 20
else
  if operation == 2
    # Subtraction
    result = num1 - num2
    print result
  else
    # Invalid operation
    print 255     # Error code
